  "Hello! I'm `Brendan Dileo`, a passionate _software developer_ with a love for creating innovative solutions and solving complex problems.",
  "My journey into technology started with video gamesâ€”my first consoles were the *Nintendo DS and Wii*. By the 5th grade, I had my first personal computer and quickly became fascinated with PC gaming and eventually `Minecraft modding`. At 11, I was introduced to programming through `Java` while trying to install the ~Minecraft Nodus Client~.",
  "By 7th grade, I built my `first custom PC` and developed a love for building, fixing, and tinkering with computers. In high school, my interest in coding, programming, and modding grew even deeper. By 11th grade, I was exploring open-source communities and experimenting with game modding.",
  "I later pursued my passion at `Mohawk College`, where I studied _full-stack development_ and expanded my knowledge of modern frameworks and technologies. Now, I'm focused on Software Development, Low-Level Programming, Automation, and Machine Learning.",
  "When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or working on personal projects that challenge my creativity."
