          Over the past couple of years, I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from
          school assignments to personal projects that helped me learn, as well as passion projects.
          The time and effort I've put into these projects has paid off, allowing me to grow as a developer.
          Below, you'll find a few of my personal and passion projects.
