Over the past couple of years, I've worked on a variety of projects, ranging from school assignments to 
                    personal projects that helped me learn, as well as passion projects. The time and effort I've put into these 
                    projects has paid off, allowing me to grow as a developer. Below, you'll find a few of my personal and passion 
                    projects.
