Hi, I'm a Software Development student and Aspiring Full Stack Developer with a passion for technology and creating.
I first fell in love with technology through video games. My first console was the PS2, and around 2006, I got a Wii and DS.
My journey with computers began in the 5th grade, when I got my first personal computer for my birthday. I quickly became fascinated with PC gaming, and eventually Minecraft modding. I wanted to install the Nodus Modded Client but I struggled to get it working. Determined to figure it out, I watched tutorials and read online documentation, my first real experience with problem-solving and troubleshooting.
By 7th grade, I built my first custom PC and ever since, I've been building, fixing, and taking apart computers, whether for fun, personal projects, or helping friends.
In 9th grade, I became even more interested in coding, programming, and modding, and by 11th grade, my passion for software development really took off. I wanted to mod Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 Zombies on PC, which led me down a rabbit hole of researching online communities and open-source tools. Without official documentation, I had to analyze decompiled game scripts, which became my first hands-on experience with coding and programming languages.
Now, I'm focused on Software Development, Automation, Machine Learning, and creating efficient solutions for complex real-world problems.
